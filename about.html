                    <p>The Campus Companion from jHawkSoft is a tool made for KU students to provide a new way to navigate the sprawling, occasionally
                confusing web of KU's resources. New students starting at KU have enough to worry about between learning how to navigate campus, 
                adjusting to classes, and building new connections. </p>
                <p>At jHawkSoft, we seek to make this process less painful by making the Campus Companion, 
                a search engine and expanding database intended specifically for KU students, containing only KU resources, including information on academic 
                departments and programs, clubs, announcements and more.As KU students, we at jHawkSoft know how frustrating and obtuse this process can be, 
                so we made the Campus Companion, allowing for all of these documents, which may have been strewn across several websites to be accessed in 
                a convenient, efficient and centralized way. </p>
                <p>The Campus Companion is not just for new students either, even established and returning KU students 
                have something to gain in using the Campus Companion. These students may know how to find much of the information they need to survive on campus, 
                but the process of navigating to everything can still be tedious and inconvenient.</p> 
                <p>The Campus Companion's focus on ease of accessing documents
                and intuitive design should allow these students to operate more efficiently, saving time and aiding in productivity. The Campus Companion 
                is a great new way to navigate your KU experience.</p><br><br>
